## 🚀 Next Steps

### **1. Database Migration**
```bash
cd packages/core-db
npx prisma migrate dev --name complete_backend
npx prisma generate
```

### **2. Configure API Keys**
- Create `.env` file with all required keys
- Start with HIGH priority services first
- Test each integration individually

### **3. Test Endpoints**
```bash
# Run development server
npm run dev

# Test authentication
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password123","role":"talent"}'

# Test login
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password123"}'
```

### **4. What's Missing (Social Login)**

The only features that require 3rd party setup and were SKIPPED:

#### **Google OAuth**
- Requires: Google Cloud Console setup
- Files to create:
  - `app/api/v1/auth/google/route.ts` (initiate)
  - `app/api/v1/auth/google/callback/route.ts` (handle callback)
- Libraries: Use `@packages/core-auth` PKCE helpers already built

#### **Apple Sign In**
- Requires: Apple Developer account
- Files to create:
  - `app/api/v1/auth/apple/route.ts` (initiate)
  - `app/api/v1/auth/apple/callback/route.ts` (handle callback)
- Libraries: Use `@packages/core-auth` PKCE helpers already built
