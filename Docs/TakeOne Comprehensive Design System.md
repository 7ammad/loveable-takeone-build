## Introduction

This comprehensive design system serves as the foundational guide for creating consistent, accessible, and culturally resonant user experiences across the TakeOne platform. TakeOne is Saudi Arabia's premier casting marketplace, designed to professionalize and democratize the entertainment industry while fostering trust, creativity, and career growth.

The design system balances professional excellence with creative expression, ensuring that every interaction reinforces TakeOne's mission to connect talent with opportunities in a secure, supportive, and inspiring environment. Built on the "KAFD Noir" aesthetic concept, this system draws inspiration from the modern architecture of Riyadh's King Abdullah Financial District while incorporating the dramatic sophistication of film noir.

## Design Philosophy

The TakeOne design system is guided by three core principles that reflect the platform's unique position in the Saudi entertainment ecosystem:

**Trust-First Design** ensures that every visual element, interaction pattern, and content structure builds confidence between users. In a marketplace where trust is the fundamental currency, the design system prioritizes transparency, verification, and security at every touchpoint.

**Cultural Resonance** acknowledges that great design must be deeply rooted in its cultural context. The system respects Saudi values and aesthetics while maintaining global appeal, supporting both Arabic (RTL) and English (LTR) languages seamlessly, and adapting to local user behaviors and expectations.

**Aspirational Professionalism** recognizes that TakeOne serves as more than a job board—it is a career-building platform that helps talent achieve their professional aspirations. The design language elevates the user experience to match the Hollywood-level ambitions of Saudi talent while providing the practical tools needed for professional growth.

## System Architecture

This design system follows a hierarchical structure based on atomic design principles, organizing elements from the smallest design tokens to complete page templates. This approach ensures scalability, maintainability, and consistency across all platform touchpoints.

The system encompasses eight core areas: brand identity and visual language framework, color and typography, component library and UI patterns, iconography and illustration guidelines, layout and responsive design, motion and interaction patterns, and comprehensive documentation of the research and analysis that informed these decisions.

## Implementation Guidelines

The TakeOne design system is built for practical implementation across web and mobile platforms. It leverages Material Design 3 as a foundational framework while customizing it extensively to reflect the unique brand identity and cultural requirements of the Saudi market.

All components are designed with accessibility in mind, meeting WCAG 2.1 AA standards and supporting users with diverse needs and abilities. The system prioritizes performance optimization, ensuring fast loading times and smooth interactions across varying device capabilities and network conditions.

The design system is intended to evolve with the platform and the broader Saudi entertainment industry. Regular updates and refinements will be made based on user feedback, market changes, and technological advances, ensuring that TakeOne remains at the forefront of design excellence and user experience innovation.

| `xl` | 32px | Section spacing, major visual breaks |
| `2xl` | 48px | Page-level spacing, hero sections |
| `3xl` | 64px | Large-scale layout spacing |

### 6.3. Component Layout Patterns

Standardized layout patterns ensure consistency across different pages and sections of the platform while providing flexibility for various content types.

#### Dashboard Layout

The dashboard layout is the primary interface for both talent and hirers, providing quick access to key information and actions.

**Structure:** The dashboard uses a three-column layout on desktop, with a collapsible sidebar navigation (3 columns), main content area (6 columns), and secondary information panel (3 columns). On tablet and mobile, the layout collapses to a single column with a hamburger menu for navigation.

#### Profile Layout

The profile layout showcases talent information in an engaging and comprehensive format that builds trust and facilitates decision-making.

**Hero Section:** A prominent header section (12 columns) features the talent's primary photo, name, headline, and key verification badges. This section uses the full width to create maximum impact.

**Content Sections:** Below the hero, content is organized into logical sections using an 8-4 column split. The main content area (8 columns) contains detailed information like experience, portfolio, and reviews, while the sidebar (4 columns) displays contact information, availability, and quick actions.

#### Search Results Layout

The search results layout provides multiple viewing options to accommodate different user preferences and use cases.

**Filter Panel:** A collapsible filter panel (3 columns on desktop) allows users to refine their search criteria. On mobile, filters are accessible through a modal overlay to preserve screen space.

**Results Area:** The main results area (9 columns on desktop) supports both list and grid views. List view provides detailed information for thorough evaluation, while grid view enables quick visual browsing of multiple options.

### 6.4. Responsive Design Strategy

The responsive design strategy ensures optimal user experience across all devices while maintaining the integrity of the brand and functionality.

#### Mobile-First Approach

The design system follows a mobile-first approach, starting with the constraints of small screens and progressively enhancing the experience for larger devices.

**Content Priority:** Mobile layouts prioritize the most essential content and actions, ensuring users can complete core tasks efficiently. Secondary information and advanced features are accessible through progressive disclosure.

**Touch Optimization:** All interactive elements meet minimum touch target sizes (44px) and include appropriate spacing to prevent accidental activation. Gesture-based interactions, such as swipe-to-delete, enhance the mobile experience.

**Performance Considerations:** Mobile layouts are optimized for performance, with careful attention to image sizes, loading states, and progressive enhancement to ensure fast loading times on slower connections.

#### RTL (Right-to-Left) Support

Given the bilingual nature of the platform, comprehensive RTL support is essential for Arabic language users.

**Layout Mirroring:** All layouts automatically mirror for RTL languages, with navigation, content flow, and interactive elements adjusting appropriately. The grid system maintains its proportions while reversing the directional flow.

**Typography Considerations:** Arabic typography requires different line heights and spacing considerations compared to Latin scripts. The responsive system accounts for these differences to ensure optimal readability in both languages.



## 7. Motion & Interaction

Motion design in the TakeOne platform is not merely decorative; it is a functional and expressive layer of the user experience. It guides users, provides meaningful feedback, and reinforces the brand's personality. The motion and interaction patterns are designed to be purposeful, brand-aligned, and performant, creating a seamless and engaging experience that feels both professional and dynamic.

### 7.1. Core Principles of Motion

Our approach to motion is guided by four core principles that ensure every animation enhances the user experience.

| Principle | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Purposeful** | Every animation has a clear purpose, whether it's guiding the user's attention, providing feedback on an action, or creating a smoother transition between states. Motion should reduce cognitive load, not add to it. |
| **Brand-Aligned** | The motion language reflects the "KAFD Noir" aesthetic: sophisticated, confident, and precise. Animations are smooth and controlled, avoiding overly playful or distracting effects. |
| **Performant** | All animations are optimized for performance across a wide range of devices and network conditions. We prioritize CSS-based animations and use hardware acceleration where possible to ensure a smooth, jank-free experience. |
| **Intuitive** | Motion follows predictable patterns, making the interface feel natural and responsive. Interactions are based on real-world physics, creating a sense of tangibility and direct manipulation. |

### 7.2. Animation System

A consistent animation system ensures a cohesive and harmonious feel across the entire platform. This system is defined by a standardized set of timings and easing functions.

#### Timing & Duration

A consistent timing scale provides a rhythmic and predictable experience. Durations are kept short to ensure the interface feels fast and responsive.

| Token | Duration (ms) | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `fast` | 100ms | Microinteractions, hover effects, subtle feedback. |
| `base` | 200ms | Standard component transitions (e.g., expanding cards, modal fade-ins). |
| `slow` | 400ms | Large-scale page transitions and complex animations. |

#### Easing Functions

Easing functions control the rate of change in an animation, giving it a more natural and organic feel.

- **`ease-in-out` (Cubic Bezier: `.42, 0, .58, 1`):** The default easing function for most UI transitions. It starts and ends slowly, creating a smooth and graceful effect.
- **`ease-out` (Cubic Bezier: `0, 0, .58, 1`):** Used for elements entering the screen. The animation starts fast and decelerates, giving it a sense of arrival.
- **`ease-in` (Cubic Bezier: `.42, 0, 1, 1`):** Used for elements exiting the screen. The animation starts slowly and accelerates, creating a sense of departure.

### 7.3. Interaction Patterns

#### 7.3.1. Microinteractions

Microinteractions are small, contained animations that provide feedback and enhance the sense of direct manipulation.

- **Hover States:** Interactive elements subtly change on hover (e.g., a slight lift or a color shift) to indicate they are clickable. The transition uses the `fast` duration and `ease-out` easing.
- **Button Clicks:** On click, buttons have a subtle press-down effect (inset shadow) and a ripple effect originating from the point of contact, providing immediate tactile feedback.
- **Form Validation:** Input fields provide real-time feedback. A gentle shake animation (`fast` duration) indicates an error, while a smooth checkmark animation confirms successful validation.

#### 7.3.2. Transitions

Transitions guide the user between different views and states, maintaining context and creating a seamless flow.

- **Fade & Scale:** Modals, dialogs, and popovers appear with a subtle fade-in and scale-up animation (`base` duration, `ease-out` easing). This draws the user's attention without being jarring.
- **Slide:** Page transitions and panel reveals use a horizontal or vertical slide animation (`slow` duration, `ease-in-out` easing). This helps to maintain a sense of spatial orientation.
- **Expand & Collapse:** Components like accordions and expandable cards use a smooth expand/collapse animation (`base` duration, `ease-in-out` easing) to reveal or hide content.

#### 7.3.3. Loading & Progress

Loading animations keep users engaged and informed during wait times, reducing perceived latency.

- **Spinners:** For indeterminate loading states, a clean, minimalist spinner animation is used. The spinner uses the primary Gold color to remain on-brand.
- **Progress Bars:** For determinate loading processes (e.g., file uploads), a linear progress bar provides clear feedback on the status. The bar animates smoothly from left to right.
- **Skeleton Screens:** For content-heavy pages, skeleton screens are used to provide an immediate impression of the layout while content is loading. A subtle, shimmering wave animation moves across the skeleton elements to indicate that the page is actively loading.

### 7.4. Implementation Guidelines

- **Prioritize CSS:** Use CSS transitions and animations for most UI motion. They are highly performant and can be hardware-accelerated by the browser.
- **Use JavaScript for Complex Logic:** For animations that require complex sequencing, physics-based motion, or interaction with user input, use a lightweight JavaScript animation library like `Framer Motion`.
- **Accessibility:** All animations must respect the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query. When this setting is enabled, all non-essential animations will be disabled or replaced with a simple fade effect. This ensures an accessible experience for users with vestibular disorders.
