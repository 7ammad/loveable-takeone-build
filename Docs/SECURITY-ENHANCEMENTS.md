## Remaining Work (Issues #51-89)

### High Priority (51-60)
- API documentation
- OpenAPI/Swagger specs
- Rate limiting enhancements
- Performance monitoring
- Circuit breaker pattern

### Medium Priority (61-70)
- Frontend security hardening
- XSS prevention in React components
- Secure state management
- React security best practices

### Low Priority (71-89)
- E2E testing
- Performance optimization
- Code quality improvements
- Documentation updates

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. Always use `requireAuth`, `requireRole`, or `requireOwnership` for protected routes
2. Never expose sensitive data in API responses
3. Use Zod schemas for all user input
4. Apply `sanitizeText` transform to free-text fields
5. Log all security-relevant actions
6. Use `createErrorResponse` for consistent error handling

### For Deployment
1. Never commit `.env` files
2. Use strong, randomly generated secrets
3. Rotate secrets every 90 days
4. Enable HTTPS in production
5. Set up monitoring and alerts
6. Regular security audits

## Compliance

### Saudi Arabia PDPL
- ✅ Data retention policies (7 years)
- ✅ Audit logging for data access
- ✅ User consent tracking ready
- ✅ Data export functionality ready

### Best Practices
- ✅ OWASP Top 10 addressed
- ✅ NIST password guidelines
- ✅ PCI DSS considerations (payment encryption)

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Review audit logs weekly
- Check for failed login attempts
- Monitor revoked token table growth
- Update dependencies monthly
- Rotate secrets quarterly

### Incident Response
1. Check audit logs for security events
2. Revoke compromised tokens immediately
3. Lock affected accounts
4. Review access logs
5. Document and remediate
