---

## üì¶ What Was Implemented

### 1. Onboarding Flow Document
**File:** `reports/implementation/CASTER_ONBOARDING_FLOW.md`

Comprehensive 300+ line document covering:
- Complete user flow (Welcome ‚Üí Type ‚Üí Basic ‚Üí Optional ‚Üí Success)
- Dynamic field specifications for all 23 company types
- Data structures and API contracts
- UI/UX guidelines
- Post-onboarding actions
- Integration points
- Success metrics

### 2. Dynamic Form Component
**File:** `components/profile/caster/DynamicCasterForm.tsx`

**Features:**
- 800+ lines of type-specific field configurations
- Support for multiple field types:
  - Text input
  - Number input
  - Select dropdown
  - Multi-select with badges
- Real-time field management
- Clean, composable architecture

**Field Examples by Type:**

| Company Type | Custom Fields |
|--------------|---------------|
| Film Production | Production Focus, Primary Shooting Location |
| TV Channels | Content Type, Audience Reach |
| Advertising Agency | Services Offered, Industries Served |
| Event Production | Event Types, Average Events/Year |
| Casting Agency | Talent Roster Size, Specializations |
| Government Ministry | Department/Division, Project Frequency |
| Independent Producer | Previous Projects, Specializations |

### 3. Enhanced Onboarding Page
**File:** `app/onboarding/caster/page.tsx`

**Updates:**
- Imported `DynamicCasterForm` component
- Added `customFields` state management
- Integrated dynamic form into basic info step
- Updated submit handler to include `typeSpecificFields`
- Reset custom fields when type changes
- Maintained existing validation and error handling

**Key Changes:**
```typescript
// State management
const [customFields, setCustomFields] = useState<CustomFields>({});

// Update handler
const updateCustomField = (field: string, value: any) => {
  setCustomFields(prev => ({ ...prev, [field]: value }));
};

// Submit payload
if (Object.keys(customFields).length > 0) {
  payload.typeSpecificFields = customFields;
}

// Form rendering
{formData.companyType && (
  <DynamicCasterForm
    companyType={formData.companyType}
    formData={customFields}
    onChange={updateCustomField}
  />
)}
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Integration

### Schema Support
**File:** `packages/core-db/prisma/schema.prisma`

The `CasterProfile` model already includes:
```prisma
model CasterProfile {
  // ... other fields
  
  // Conditional Fields (JSON for flexibility)
  typeSpecificFields Json?
  
  // ... other fields
}
```

This JSON field stores all dynamic type-specific data without requiring schema migrations for each new field.

### API Support
**File:** `app/api/v1/caster-profiles/[id]/route.ts`

The PATCH endpoint already includes `typeSpecificFields` in `allowedFields` array (line 170), so no API changes were needed.
