## 🎨 Type Selection Step (New Design)

### Step 2A: Caster Structure Selection

**Question:** "What type of caster are you?"

**Options:**

1. **Independent Caster**
   - Icon: Users
   - Description: "Freelance producer, director, or casting professional"
   - Auto-sets: 
     - `companyType: 'independent_producer'`
     - `companyCategory: 'corporate'`
     - `companySize: 'freelance'`

2. **Company**
   - Icon: Building
   - Description: "Production company, agency, or organization"
   - Triggers: Company type dropdown

### Step 2B: Company Type Dropdown (Conditional)

Only appears if user selects "Company"

**Dropdown with optgroups:**
```
Select your company type...

## 💻 Technical Implementation

### State Management

```typescript
// New state
const [casterStructure, setCasterStructure] = useState<'independent' | 'company' | ''>('');

// Existing states (unchanged)
const [formData, setFormData] = useState<FormData>({...});
const [customFields, setCustomFields] = useState<CustomFields>({});
```

### Independent Selection Logic

```typescript
onClick={() => {
  setCasterStructure('independent');
  updateFormData('companyCategory', 'corporate');
  updateFormData('companyType', 'independent_producer');
  updateFormData('companySize', 'freelance');
}}
```

### Company Selection Logic

```typescript
onClick={() => {
  setCasterStructure('company');
  // Reset type/category, user must select from dropdown
  updateFormData('companyType', '');
  updateFormData('companyCategory', '');
}}
```

### Validation Logic

```typescript
const handleTypeSubmit = () => {
  if (!casterStructure) {
    setError('Please select if you are independent or a company');
    return;
  }
  if (!formData.companyType) {
    setError('Please select your caster type');
    return;
  }
  setCurrentStep('basic');
};
```

## 🔄 Updated Basic Info Labels

Labels now adapt based on `casterStructure`:

### Independent Caster:

- **Placeholder:** "e.g. Ahmed Al-Saud"
- **Description:** "Tell us about yourself"

### Company:
- **Field:** "Company Name (English)"
- **Placeholder:** "e.g. Riyadh Productions"
- **Description:** "Tell us about your company"

## 🐛 Fixed Issues

### Import Error Fix
**File:** `app/api/v1/caster-profiles/route.ts`, `app/api/v1/caster-profiles/[id]/route.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
import { verifyAccessToken } from '@/packages/core-auth/jwt';
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { verifyAccessToken } from '@packages/core-auth';
```

**Reason:** Correct import path for workspace packages
