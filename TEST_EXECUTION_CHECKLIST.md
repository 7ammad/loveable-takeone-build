# Digital Twin Test Execution Checklist

Use this checklist to track your testing progress. Check off each item as you complete it.

---

## üéØ Test Objective
Verify that the Digital Twin can automatically discover casting opportunities from external sources, extract structured data using AI, and publish them to the platform after admin review.

---

## üìã Phase 1: Infrastructure Validation

### Database
- [ ] PostgreSQL is running
- [ ] Can connect to DATABASE_URL
- [ ] Run: `curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/casting-calls` (should return data or empty array)
- [ ] Tables exist: `IngestionSource`, `CastingCall`

### Redis
- [ ] Redis is installed and running
- [ ] Test connection: `redis-cli ping` (should return "PONG")
- [ ] Or verify REDIS_URL is set for cloud Redis

### OpenAI
- [ ] OPENAI_API_KEY is set in `.env.local`
- [ ] API key is valid (check on platform.openai.com)
- [ ] Account has available quota

### Digital Twin Service
- [ ] Dev server started successfully
- [ ] Check logs for: "ü§ñ Starting Digital Twin Background Service..."
- [ ] Check logs for: "‚úÖ Digital Twin service started"
- [ ] Test status: `curl http://localhost:3000/api/digital-twin/status`
- [ ] Response shows `"isRunning": true`

**Phase 1 Result**: ‚úÖ PASS / ‚ùå FAIL

---

## üìù Phase 2: Ingestion Sources Management

### Create Sources
- [ ] Create web source via API or admin UI
- [ ] Create Instagram source
- [ ] Verify sources appear in database
- [ ] Verify sources appear in admin dashboard (`/admin`)

### List Sources
- [ ] GET `/api/v1/admin/sources` returns created sources
- [ ] Pagination works (if implemented)
- [ ] Can filter by sourceType

### Update Sources
- [ ] Can edit source name
- [ ] Can toggle `isActive` status
- [ ] Changes persist to database

### Delete Sources
- [ ] Can delete a source (if no references)
- [ ] Deleted source doesn't appear in list

**Test Commands**:
```bash
# Create source
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/admin/sources \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sourceType":"WEB","sourceIdentifier":"https://example.com","sourceName":"Test","isActive":true}'

# List sources
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/admin/sources \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

**Phase 2 Result**: ‚úÖ PASS / ‚ùå FAIL

---

## üöÄ Phase 3: Manual Orchestration Trigger

### Trigger Orchestration
- [ ] POST to `/api/digital-twin/status` triggers orchestration
- [ ] Response confirms trigger was successful
- [ ] Status shows "Running" or updated timestamp

### Monitor Logs
- [ ] Watch server logs for next 60 seconds
- [ ] See: "üåê Starting web orchestration..."
- [ ] See: "üì∑ Starting Instagram orchestration..."
- [ ] See: "ü§ñ Processing scraped content"
- [ ] See: "‚úÖ Extracted structured data" (if valid content found)

### Error Handling
- [ ] Invalid URLs are caught gracefully
- [ ] Errors are logged but don't crash the service
- [ ] Failed jobs appear in logs

**Test Command**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/digital-twin/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

**Phase 3 Result**: ‚úÖ PASS / ‚ùå FAIL

---

## ü§ñ Phase 4: LLM Extraction Testing

### Valid Content Extraction
- [ ] LLM extracts casting call title
- [ ] Role description is captured
- [ ] Requirements are extracted
- [ ] Location identified (if present)
- [ ] Data structure is correct

### Invalid Content Filtering
- [ ] Non-casting content is filtered out
- [ ] No invalid data enters validation queue
- [ ] LLM correctly identifies non-relevant content

### Check Logs
- [ ] LLM extraction logs show processing
- [ ] No OpenAI API errors
- [ ] Extraction time is reasonable (<10 seconds per job)

**Phase 4 Result**: ‚úÖ PASS / ‚ùå FAIL

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 5: Validation Queue Testing

### Queue Population
- [ ] Navigate to `/admin/validation-queue`
- [ ] Extracted casting calls appear in queue
- [ ] Status is "pending"
- [ ] All required fields are present (title, description, etc.)
- [ ] Source information is attached

### Approve Workflow
- [ ] Click "Approve" on a casting call
- [ ] Confirmation message appears
- [ ] Call status changes to "open"
- [ ] Call disappears from pending queue

### Edit Workflow
- [ ] Click "Edit" on a casting call
- [ ] Can modify title, description, requirements
- [ ] Save changes
- [ ] Changes persist
- [ ] Can approve after editing

### Reject Workflow
- [ ] Click "Reject" on a casting call
- [ ] Confirmation dialog appears
- [ ] Call status changes to "rejected"
- [ ] Call disappears from pending queue

**Test Commands**:
```bash
# Get validation queue
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/admin/digital-twin/validation-queue \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Approve casting call
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/admin/casting-calls/{ID}/approve \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

**Phase 5 Result**: ‚úÖ PASS / ‚ùå FAIL

- [ ] BullMQ workers show concurrency

### Large Content
- [ ] Test with a very long web page (>50KB)
- [ ] Test with multiple Instagram posts

- [ ] Memory usage remains stable

### Rate Limiting
- [ ] OpenAI API calls respect rate limits
- [ ] Failed jobs retry appropriately
- [ ] Costs remain within budget (<$1 for test)

**Phase 7 Result**: ‚úÖ PASS / ‚ùå FAIL

- [ ] Pending items count is correct
- [ ] Recent activity log shows latest events
- [ ] Can manually trigger orchestration from dashboard

### Logging

- [ ] Logs are searchable/readable

### Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)
- [ ] Failed jobs appear in DLQ
