# Next Steps - Action Plan

## üî¥ Current Situation

**Posts analyzed**: 41 from OLD orchestration cycle (BEFORE filtering was implemented)
**Result**: Only 1-2 actual casting calls out of 41 (98% false positive rate)

**Why?**
- These posts were scraped BEFORE we:
  - Added 60+ Arabic keywords
  - Implemented strict pre-filtering
  - Enhanced LLM prompt with Saudi-specific validation
  - Re-activated all 75 sources

## ‚úÖ What's Now in Place

### Sources (75 total, ALL ACTIVE):
- **18 Casting Agencies** ‚úÖ (Gulf Casting, Mr.Casting, Persona17, Casting Arabia, MBC Talent, Aurora, The Casting Studio, Casting Secret, etc.)
- **14 Web Platforms** ‚úÖ (Mixfame, Casting Arabia website, etc.)
- **43 Individual Accounts** ‚úÖ (Directors/producers - kept per your request)

### Filtering System (3 Layers):
1. **Pre-Filter** ‚úÖ - 60+ Arabic keywords, rejects before LLM
2. **LLM Validation** ‚úÖ - Saudi-focused prompt with strict criteria
3. **Post-Processing** ‚úÖ - Validation queue for admin review

## üéØ What Needs to Happen

### The Next Orchestration Cycle Will:
1. Scrape **18 casting agency accounts** (most likely to have calls)
2. Apply **pre-filter** with expanded Arabic keywords
3. Send remaining posts to **LLM with strict Saudi-focused prompt**
4. Only create casting calls that pass ALL criteria

## ‚è∞ When Will We See Results?

**Next Automatic Cycle**: Every 4 hours
- Current time: Check logs or `/admin/validation-queue`
- Last cycle: ~05:03 UTC (from logs)
- Next cycle: ~09:03 UTC (approximately)

OR

**Manual Trigger**: You can trigger it now via admin panel

## üìä Expected Improvement

### Before (Current Validation Queue):
- 98% false positives
- Workshops, screenings, personal posts
- From OLD cycle WITHOUT filtering

### After (Next Cycle):
- Pre-filter should reject 60-70% immediately
- LLM should reject another 20-30%
- **Target: <10% false positive rate**
- Focus on 18 casting agencies = higher quality

## üöÄ Immediate Actions

### Option A: Wait for Automatic Cycle (Recommended)
1. Wait ~4 hours for next automatic cycle
2. Check logs for:
   ```
   ‚è≠Ô∏è  Skipped (not casting content)  // Pre-filter working
   ‚è≠Ô∏è  LLM rejected: [reason]          // LLM validation working
   ‚úÖ Created casting call: [title]    // Real casting calls
   ```
3. Run validation queue check:
   ```powershell
   pnpm tsx scripts/check-validation-queue.ts
   ```

### Option B: Manual Trigger (Immediate Test)
1. Go to `/admin` dashboard
2. Find "Digital Twin Status" or manual trigger
3. Start orchestration cycle manually
4. Monitor logs in real-time
5. Check validation queue after completion

## üîç How to Validate Success

### 1. Check Server Logs
Look for new patterns:
- **Pre-filter rejections**: "‚è≠Ô∏è  Skipped (not casting content)"
- **LLM rejections**: "‚è≠Ô∏è  LLM rejected: [reason]"
- **Successful extractions**: "‚úÖ Created casting call: [Arabic title]"

### 2. Run Validation Queue Check
```powershell
cd C:\dev\builds\enter-tech
pnpm tsx scripts/check-validation-queue.ts
```

Look for:
- Arabic casting call titles (not "Instagram Post from...")
- Fewer workshops ("Ÿàÿ±ÿ¥ÿ©")
- Fewer screenings
- More calls with "ŸÖÿ∑ŸÑŸàÿ®" / "ŸÑŸÑÿ™ŸÇÿØŸäŸÖ"

### 3. Manual Review in Admin Panel
Go to `/admin/validation-queue`:
- Review titles - should be actual casting calls
- Check for Arabic content preservation
- Verify application instructions are present
- Confirm deadlines are mentioned

## üìà Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | How to Check |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **Pre-filter rejection rate** | 60-70% | Count "Skipped" in logs |
| **LLM rejection rate** | 20-30% | Count "LLM rejected" in logs |
| **False positive rate** | <10% | Manual review of queue |
| **Casting agencies scraped** | 18/18 | Check logs for source names |
| **Arabic content preserved** | 100% | Titles/descriptions in Arabic |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è If Results Are Still Poor

### Possible Issues:
1. **Instagram scraper not working** - Check Apify API key
2. **Casting agencies don't post often** - Agencies may post weekly, not daily
3. **Keywords still not matching** - Need to refine based on ACTUAL agency posts
4. **LLM being too strict** - May need to relax criteria slightly

### Next Steps if Issues Found:
1. Manually check agency Instagram pages to see what they actually post
2. Extract real keywords from verified casting calls
3. Adjust pre-filter to match agency posting patterns
4. Fine-tune LLM prompt based on real examples

## üí° Key Insight

**The posts we analyzed (41 items) are from the OLD system.**  
**The NEW filtering hasn't been tested yet in a real orchestration cycle.**

We need to wait for the next cycle to see if the 3-layer filtering system actually works with the 18 casting agency accounts.

## üé¨ Ready to Test

Everything is in place:
- ‚úÖ 75 sources active (18 casting agencies)
- ‚úÖ 60+ Arabic keywords
- ‚úÖ Strict pre-filtering
- ‚úÖ Saudi-focused LLM prompt
- ‚úÖ Monitoring tools ready

**Next**: Wait for orchestration cycle or manually trigger to test the system!
