## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Database Migration
The `roles` field is in the schema but **not yet migrated**. Current behavior:
- Roles are merged into `requirements` field
- After migration, roles will be separate
- Uncomment line 221 in `workers-init.ts` after migration

### Webhook Setup
1. Deploy application first (get production URL)
2. Add environment variables to production
3. Run configuration script
4. Test with real message

### Cost Tracking
- Metrics calculate in real-time
- Based on actual usage from database
- Some services are estimates (Vercel bandwidth, etc.)
- Export CSV monthly for accurate accounting
