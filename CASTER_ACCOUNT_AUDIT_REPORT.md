## 🎯 Audit Findings

### 1. Navigation Component (`components/DashboardNav.tsx`)

const casterNavLinks = [
  { href: '/dashboard', label: 'Dashboard', icon: Home },
  { href: '/casting-calls/manage', label: 'My Jobs', icon: FileText },
  { href: '/casting-calls/create', label: 'Post Job', icon: Plus },
  { href: '/applications/caster', label: 'Applications', icon: FileText },
  { href: '/bookings', label: 'Auditions', icon: Calendar },
  { href: '/talent', label: 'Search Talent', icon: Users },
  { href: '/messages', label: 'Messages', icon: MessageCircle },
];

const navLinks = user?.role === 'talent' ? talentNavLinks : casterNavLinks;
```

**Caster-specific menu items:**
